##Spunkybot
A discord bot that runs in node.js, based on inspired heavily by undergroundfanclub's frog-statue, and a lot of youtube bot tutorials. This was my first foray with javascript.

###it does:
not very much. It responds to messages that it interprets as commands, with a user configurable prefix. Spunky is an anarchist and doesn't recognize user perms or roles. The most interesting thing about the bot is the included art folder which comes with some neat ascii art and a gif. The character design is based on Mulbruk from La-Mulana.

###instructions
copy or rename config.json.example, as config.json, paste your bot's token into the config.json, and run `node .`. Obviously, requires node.js to run.
